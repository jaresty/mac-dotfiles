# Evaluation Prompts
coach: Evaluate this code with a focus on potential changes. Each unit of code should have only one reason to change. Identify areas for improvement to enhance the design.

# Editing Prompts
split: You are an editor. The text below contains multiple topics. Your job is to separate these topics into sections and arrange them clearly. Provide only the reformatted text.
shorten: As an editor, shorten the following text while preserving its meaning. Return just the modified text.
flatten: Edit the text below to form a single, cohesive, and grammatically correct paragraph that clearly communicates the main points. Provide the modified version only.
compare: This text contains similar but not identical ideas. Create a table listing each comparison once to highlight these subtle differences. Omit ideas that appear only once. Ensure the table width does not exceed 100 characters, wrapping text to new lines as necessary.
shuffle: Reconstruct the following text to ensure the layout is logical and significantly different from the original. Create new categories, each representing a single idea without using conjunctions like AND or OR. Present the revised text in the same language.
describe split: As an editor, suggest different ways to categorize or split the following text, which contains multiple interrelated topics. Return just the modified text.
describe style: Act as a prompt engineer. I want you to describe the style of this text so that I can use your response as instructions to reformat some other text to match that style. Include an example for clarity.
match style: I have given you some context to describe a style of writing that I would like to use. Please make this text match that style. Return just the modified text.
make abstract: The prompt asks for two tasks: shortening text while preserving its meaning and abstracting any specifics to a higher level of abstraction. The response combines these tasks into a single instruction: condense the text, maintain its essence, and generalize if specific.
sort interest: As an editor, reorder the text so the most surprising or interesting part comes first. Maintain the current tone. Return just the modified text.
sort abstraction: As an editor, reorder the text from most to least abstract. Add transitions and labels for flow, ensuring it reads like a substitution in the same context. Return just the modified text.
sort direct: As an editor, reorder the text to be more direct. Lead with the main point and follow up with auxiliary information. Return just the modified text.
sort indirect: As an editor, reorder the text to be more indirect. Lead with auxiliary information and conclude with the main point. Return just the modified text.

# Software Engineering Prompts
guard: As a software engineer, refactor this code to handle error cases first. Use guard clauses or throw errors where appropriate. Return just the modified text for direct insertion into code.
add API docs: As a software engineer, add API documentation to the following code. Include documentation for all parameters used. Return just the modified text.
fix duplication: As a software engineer, reduce duplication in the following code without changing its behavior. Return just the new code for direct insertion.
sort complexity: As a software engineer, reorder the following code to place the most complex parts first. Return just the modified text.

# Analysis Prompts
list obscure: As a reader, identify all terms in the following text that are not defined. Return just the list of terms.
list dependencies: As a reader, identify all dependencies in the following text and what they depend on. Consider something a dependency if both it and what it depends on are listed. Return just the list of dependencies.
explain prompt: Analyze the provided prompt and response. Explain how the prompt was understood to generate the given response. Provide only the explanation.
interpret: Formulate multiple reasonable interpretations of this, considering different perspectives.

# Generation Prompts
generate liberated exercise: As a facilitator, design a problem-solving process for full group participation using liberating structures or similar techniques. Make it suitable for an online meeting with no more than three activities. Return just the process.
generate traditional exercise: As a facilitator, design a problem-solving process for full group participation without breakouts. Make it engaging and fun, suitable for an online meeting with no more than three activities. Return just the process.
vary prompt: As a prompt engineer, craft several alternative versions of this prompt to increase its effectiveness. If there is any ambiguity in the intention, provide responses that explore the different possible meanings.
assist me: I have a problem that I do not know how to solve. Help me think through a quick plan to solve this problem. What steps should I take so I can resolve this today?

# Formatting Prompts
format todo: As an organizational expert familiar with GTD, annotate each task in the following text with context and relative size tags. Output the tasks as a markdown todo list. Return just the tasks.
format heading: As an editor, create a heading that encapsulates the text below. Return just the heading.
format gherkin: As a product manager, reformat the following text into proper gherkin without adding new criteria. Use Jira markup for formatting. Return just the modified text.
